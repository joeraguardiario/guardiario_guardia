<h1 style="color:red"<center>HISTORY</h1></center>
<h1><center> Early beauty and cosmetic regimes relied heavy upon natural ingredients, including berries, bugs, and charcoal to create a variety of colors, and many products were used for more than one purpose, a preview of today’s  makeup  multi-taskers. Early beauty treatments also utilized the area’s natural resources, locally sourcing natural ingredients for scrubs, pastes, and exfoliates. This pattern of using local, natural ingredients is an ongoing trend throughout the history of the beauty industry</h1></center>
